MapPuzzle.gl is an experimental website, developed with React and Deck.gl. It is an accessible way to learn cartography, through this project I try to offer an interactive learning experience with maps.

## Description of the game

MapPuzzle.xyz is a fun way to learn geography in a playful way. The game features a list of puzzle pieces on the left side of the screen, which can be countries, states, cities, or provinces, among others. Each piece is shown with a map illustration and when clicked, it follows the mouse and the player must find its match on the map. It also has a counter for found pieces, pieces to be found, and mistakes made. Players can choose the map they want to play and filter it by continent and region.

One of the interesting features of the game is that it allows players to translate the names of the puzzle pieces into different languages. This allows them to learn the names of the places in different languages, enriching their gaming experience and helping them develop their language skills.

In addition, every time a piece is placed on the map, players can access Wikipedia data about the place they are exploring. This allows them to obtain additional information about the geography, history, culture, and other areas related to the place, helping them learn more about the world around them.

In summary, the map puzzle game offers a complete and fun educational experience for all ages. Don't miss out on trying it!

## Code description

To develop the game, the Deck.gl library was used, which allows creating interactive maps on the web using JavaScript and WebGL. This library is a powerful and versatile tool that facilitates the development of map applications on the web, offering a wide variety of components and layers that can be used to create custom and highly interactive maps.

In addition, other technologies and tools such as React, sqlite, PHP, typeorm, and node.js have been used to implement different functionalities and improve the game experience. React has been used as a user interface development framework, sqlite has been used to store and retrieve data in a local database, PHP has been used to develop server scripts, typeorm has been used to manage the database, and node.js has been used as an execution environment to run the server scripts.

In terms of the project structure, the game is divided into different components and modules that are responsible for different tasks. For example, there are components that are responsible for displaying the puzzle piece list and the map, others that manage the game logic and interact with players, and others that are responsible for obtaining and processing Wikipedia and translation data.

In summary, the map puzzle game has been developed using advanced technologies and web development tools, and is structured in a modular and efficient way to facilitate its maintenance and expansion.
